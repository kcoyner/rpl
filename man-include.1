[description]
Basic usage is to specify two strings and one or more filenames or
directories on the command line.
The first string is the string to replace, and the second string is
the replacement string.

[examples]
Replace all occurrences of ‘F’ (on word boundaries) with ‘A’
in all text files under the
.I grades/
directory:
.PP
.nf
.RS
find grades/ -name '*.txt' | xargs rpl \-wd 'F' 'A'
.RE

[>copyright]
.PP
This program was written for Debian as a free replacement for the non-free
.B rpl
program by Joe Laffey.
