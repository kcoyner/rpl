/Search and replace/
Text matching the pattern \fIOLD-TEXT\fR is replaced by \fINEW-TEXT\fR in each \fIFILE\fR. The pattern may match multiple lines.

Filenames may include glob patterns (these must be quoted to
avoid being interpreted by the shell), and in particular may use ‘\fI**\fR’ to
match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. Tilde and
environment variable expansion is also performed.

[examples]
Replace all occurrences of the word ‘F’ with ‘A’
in all files with extension \fI.txt\fR under the
.I grades/
directory:
.PP
.nf
.RS
rpl \-w F A 'grades/**/*.txt'
.RE
